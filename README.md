# Machine Learning-Based Disease Prediction Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Machine Learning-Based Disease Prediction Application repository. This application leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-entered symptoms. It also provides recommendations for medications and medical tests. This README file details the specifications, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to detail the specifications for a machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of diseases and provides recommendations for medications and medical tests based on user-entered symptoms. This document is intended for use by developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders involved in the project.

## Scope

The application will:
- Allow users to input their symptoms.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the possibility of diseases.
- Suggest appropriate medications and medical tests based on user entered symptom and disease respectively.
- Feature a user-friendly interface.

### Product Functions

- Symptom input by users.
- Disease prediction using ML algorithms.
- Medication and test recommendations.

### Constraints

- The system must comply with healthcare data privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
- The application must be accessible via both web and mobile platforms.
- The system must efficiently manage a large number of simultaneous users.

### Assumptions

- The accuracy of disease predictions depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data.
- The application relies on external medical databases for information on medications and tests.
- Users have reliable internet access.
